spaCy: For pre-trained embeddings (e.g., en_core_web_md model with 96D vectors).
Keras: To train a neural network on embedded symptom inputs.

Opted to use Embeddings rather than OHE for:
Flexibility: Handles free-text inputs without needing exact matches to a predefined symptom list.
Scalability: Dense vectors (e.g., 96D) are more compact than one-hot vectors (e.g., 1,000D for 1,000 symptoms).
Semantics: Captures relationships (e.g., "tired" â‰ˆ "fatigue") via pre-trained language models.
