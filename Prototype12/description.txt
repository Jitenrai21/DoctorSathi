Trying on smaller architecture.
Augmentation using SMOTE and embedding context.
Tried on original dataset 'Symptoms2Diseases.csv' -> train_model.ipynb


Trying on Preprocssed Dataset:
Tried TFIDF and Embedding,
Since the embedding-based approach is clearly superior, let’s focus on optimizing it. Here’s a plan to enhance performance:

Model Optimization: Tune RandomForest hyperparameters or switch to a more powerful classifier (e.g., XGBoost).
Feature Engineering: Refine embeddings (e.g., weighted symptom averaging, disease-specific priors).
Cross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation for a more robust performance estimate.
Error Analysis: Identify misclassified diseases to target specific improvements.
Data Quality: Ensure synthetic embeddings align with real symptom patterns.
