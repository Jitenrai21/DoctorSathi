Since the Fine-Tune BioWordVec Embeddings approach didn’t fully resolve the issue, let’s move to the Transformer-Based Architecture approach. A transformer can better capture the relationships between symptoms by using self-attention to weigh the importance of each symptom in the context of the others. For example, it might learn that "fever, cough" together are more indicative of Common Cold than Bronchial Asthma, even if "cough" alone might lean toward asthma.

We’ll keep the fine-tuned BioWordVec embeddings (since they improved confidence slightly) and modify the model architecture to include a transformer layer. We’ll also use the augmented dataset to ensure robustness to partial symptom inputs.
