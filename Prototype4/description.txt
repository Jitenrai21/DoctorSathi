The approach with transfer learning. Fine tuning from BERT model.

Transfer Learning Concept
Base Model: Use a pre-trained BioBERT model (e.g., dmis-lab/biobert-base-cased-v1.1), which is already trained on vast biomedical text (e.g., PubMed).
Fine-Tuning: Add a small classification head (e.g., Dense layer) on top of BioBERT and fine-tune it on your DiseaseAndSymptoms.csv data. Freeze most of BioBERT’s layers to retain its general knowledge, and train only the top layers or a subset to adapt to your task.
Input Handling: Pass full symptom strings directly to BioBERT without breaking them into individual words or relying on fuzzy matching for embedding. This preserves context, which BioBERT can interpret effectively.
Data Limitation: With 410 samples and 41 diseases, fine-tuning with careful regularization (e.g., dropout, early stopping) will help avoid overfitting.
# Optional: Unfreeze some BioBERT layers for further fine-tuning (if confidence is still low)
# biobert.trainable = True  # to fine-tune BioBERT
# model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-5), loss="categorical_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])
# model.fit([X_train_ids, X_train_mask], y_train, validation_data=([X_test_ids, X_test_mask], y_test), epochs=5, batch_size=8)

*** The prototype that never promised any improvements. *** 
Thus, DROPPED!!!

Possible Problems:
Model Training: The BioBERT head might not have been trained long enough, or fine-tuning wasn’t effective.
Data Loading: The script might have loaded a subset (e.g., 410 rows) instead of the full 4920 due to a file path or preprocessing error.
Hyperparameters: Batch size, learning rate, or epochs might not have been optimized for this scale(4920 rows).
